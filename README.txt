GROFF FILES FOR GENERAL PURPOSE TYPESETTING

This repo contains the files of what I do in groff.
I'm still learning. For now I only work with the mom macros.
I use eqn for maths, and I'll get into refer for bibliographies.

If you are a TeX convert like me, check a tool on ctan called tex2refer.
It's an awk script to convert your existing TeX .bib files to refer.
